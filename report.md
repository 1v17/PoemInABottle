# Architectural Trade-offs for Cloud-Native Applications: A Case Study of "Poem In A Bottle"

## Executive Summary

This report examines the architectural trade-offs between serverless and traditional server-based deployments for low-data-flow applications in AWS. Using the "Poem In A Bottle" collaborative poetry application as a case study, we analyze **cost efficiency**, **operational overhead**, **scalability characteristics**, and **performance implications** of two distinct implementation approaches. The findings demonstrate that while serverless architectures offer compelling advantages for low-traffic applications with variable workloads, traditional server-based architectures remain competitive for stable, predictable workloads.
